### Progress Summary
This week, I started the implementation of the JPS algorithm. I created classes such as **Node**, **JPS**, and **Grid**, as well as their corresponding unit test classes.


### Challenges
I encountered some minor difficulties during the code implementation, but they were quickly resolved. Most of the time was spent working with unit tests, particularly with setting up JUnit 5. Eventually, this issue was resolved as well. However, the tests are not yet fully complete, and Iâ€™m still working on them.


### Next Steps
- Finalize the unit tests
- Improve the algorithm implementation
- Work on test coverage computation
