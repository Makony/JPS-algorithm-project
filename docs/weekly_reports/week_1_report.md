# Report Week 1

## Project: Jump Point Search  
**Student**: Makhabbat Kazhybayeva

### 1. Progress Summary
This week, I began working on the project and successfully connected it to the GitHub repository I created. Additionally, I registered in LabTool and linked the repository there.

### 2. Project Topic
I have chosen the **Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm** as the primary focus of my project. Currently, I am in the process of familiarizing myself with the algorithm in preparation for implementation.

### 3. Challenges
I initially encountered some confusion with my registration in LabTool. Specifically, I was unsure if I had registered for the correct course, as it showed **"Period 1."** Fortunately, this issue has now been resolved.

Another area of uncertainty is whether I am required to select and implement a second algorithm to compare against JPS at the end. I am still reviewing all project requirements to ensure I fully understand the expectations.

### 4. Next Steps
For the next steps, I plan to:
- Deepen my understanding of the Jump Point Search algorithm through further study and analysis.
- Begin the implementation phase once I have a solid grasp of the algorithm’s workings.
