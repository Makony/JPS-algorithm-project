# Report Week 6

## Project: Jump Point Search  
**Student**: Makhabbat Kazhybayeva

### Progress Summary
This week most of the time I spent on fixing bugs in the code. I was figuring out how to work with .map and .scen files and added functionality for scanning these files. Also I analyzed my peer review and applied suggestions to my code. 


### Challenges
I spent hours trying to figure out why the program gives incorrect output or just crashes for certain inputs. I had to rewrite almost the entire code. In the end the issue was with the implementation of the jump method.

After comparing the runtime of JPS and A* algorithms, the program currently shows that JPS is slower. I am working on fixing this.


### Next Steps
- Optimizing JPS algorithm
- Peer review 2
- Filling out the rest of the documents
