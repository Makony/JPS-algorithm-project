### Progress Summary
This week, I completed all the necessary components for the JPS algorithm, created test classes for each class and implemented their unit tests. I also finally installed JUnit5 and was able to run the tests.


### Challenges
A significant amount of time and effort went into setting up JUnit5 to work with the tests. After a long struggle, this issue was resolved. Additionally, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting why one of the methods was failing its test, but this problem was eventually resolved as well.


### Next Steps
- Begin filling out the implementation, user guide, and testing documents
- Peer reviews
