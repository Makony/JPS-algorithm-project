### Progress Summary
This week, I learned about the essential documents required for the project and what each document should contain. I created these documents and wrote the project specification. In the process, I deepened my understanding of the JPS algorithm. I also became familiar with new tools like Checkstyle and JaCoCo.


### Challenges
There were no significant challenges; however, since I hadn’t worked with Checkstyle and JaCoCo before, I needed to learn how to use them first.


### Next Steps
- Begin code implementation
- Develop unit tests
- Work on test coverage computation
